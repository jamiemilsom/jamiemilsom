# Hi, im Jamie ‚õ∞Ô∏è
I‚Äôm a passionate Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. My focus is on solving complex, multidisciplinary problems using both traditional and modern machine learning techniques.

With experience as a Research Engineer and hands-on expertise in various machine learning methods, I'm always exploring new applications. My interests span diverse fields, including fraud detection in banking, biomarker analysis in biology, and sports technology. I‚Äôm particularly excited about the potential of data to drive impactful solutions across industries.

When I‚Äôm not deep in data, you‚Äôll find me hitting the trails for a run or scaling the nearest crag üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
